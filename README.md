# The issues i have

1) In App.js
 comment the "return data" and uncomment this console.log to see the error and it will fetch the data but throw an error
     console.log(data)

# After the above instruction then the main issue will appear

2) This was the initial map function i did which was working fine to a point

posts.map((post) => ()
